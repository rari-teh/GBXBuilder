# GBXBuilder
This program appends a footer to a Game Boy (Color) ROM for use with GBX-compliant emulators, such as [hhugboy](https://github.com/tzlion/hhugboy). GBX is a footered Game Boy (Color) ROM format that includes metadata like mapper type and RAM size. This is only useful for emulating unlicensed cartridges, which often have wrong metadata on the internal header to make piracy more difficult.

The GBX ROM format was created by [taizou](https://github.com/tzlion). The file format specification is available [here](http://hhug.me/gbx/1.0).

Made with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
